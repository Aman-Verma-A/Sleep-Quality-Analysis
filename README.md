This repository contains a machine learning-based solution for analyzing and evaluating sleep quality. The project leverages various sleep-related metrics such as sleep duration, heart rate variability, sleep stages, and movement data to provide an assessment of an individual's sleep quality.

Features
Data Processing: Tools for handling raw sleep data from wearable devices, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers.
Sleep Quality Metrics: Includes analysis based on parameters like total sleep time, sleep efficiency, REM sleep, and deep sleep stages.
Visualization: Interactive visualizations to represent sleep patterns and trends over time.
Machine Learning Models: Predictive models that assess the quality of sleep based on historical data.
Recommendations: Personalized sleep improvement tips based on analysis results.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)
